<h1> Weekly Reflection #11 </h1>

<p> This week we took the midterm exam. there was 2 versions. I did version 2. In that version there is one question I want to anilize with everyone today. It is question 23 on version 2. In that question we have an exsspression. It is (+ (/56 (*2 4)) (-3 -7)) or in other words ((56/(2*4))+(-3 -7)). Our question was to solve this. Here were the Awnser choices given. (A) 12 (B) 17 (C) 10 (D) 11. According to the Awnser key the correct awnser is (B). But if you do the math correctly you will see that there is no correct awnsers. So in otherwords the test makersmade a mistake. The correct awnser was -3. But it was not an awnser choice this making it no correct awnsers. This issue has been known after 1/2 of my class kept telling our teacher about it. So know it will not count. YAY</p>
