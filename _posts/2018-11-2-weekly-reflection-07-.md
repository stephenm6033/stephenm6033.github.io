<p> This week I learned that a computer needs every signle detail inorder to create what you want. I also learned how to create our own code for the  computer. Today my CS teacher gave everyone in our class a book that has code in it. In other news I learned that I will be taking the CS AP exam this year and next year. Expect an AP section in the update this weekly reflection is coming out in.</p>
