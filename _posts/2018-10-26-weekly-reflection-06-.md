<h1> Weekly Reflection #6 </h1>
<p> this 1/3 of a semester I learned about how a coumputer thinks. I also learned how to create this website and give you everything you see here. I during my 1/3 of this semester I learned of a website called weSheme.com. this is a website where you can code your own game or play a very glitchy game. In this website I attempted to create a flag and learn a new coding language. it has been a fun 1/3 of a semester. I hope to give this website more in the near future.</p>
