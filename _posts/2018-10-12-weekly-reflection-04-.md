<h1> Weekly Reflection #4 </h1>
<p>this week in CS I finished working on our recration of a flag with papper. we did this so week can later code it. we also learned how to put 1 obeject on top of anouther in weSheme.com. 1 challenge i had was puting more than 1 object on top of anouther object. i remebered how in math you do what ever is in the equation first. so i tried to do that in code for the objects. i finally able to get 2 objects on top of 1. the code looked something like this. (put-image(circle 25 "solid" "green") 25 120 (put-image(circle 25 "solid" "blue") 120 25(square 150 "solid" "red"))). so that was my week in CS.</p>
