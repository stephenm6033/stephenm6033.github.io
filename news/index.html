At the same time, the republicans gained 2 seats in the senate. So Democrats and Republicans both win because they both got more representation in different ways.</p>

A new trend that has happen this holiday season is people paying for everyone’s packages in the stores across America because they thought it was nice and mainly for the attention. </p>
