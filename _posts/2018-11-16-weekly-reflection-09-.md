  <h1> Weekly Reflection # 9 </h1>
<p> This week we learned more about definitions and more practice. We also looked at some mistakes and we learned how to fix them and the correct format for them. This has been a short school week so we did not learn a lot. We were going to do a rocket ship program today because we did not finish it yesterday. </p>
